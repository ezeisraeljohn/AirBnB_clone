# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

This project is an AirBnB clone, which includes a custom command-line interpreter (console) for managing and interacting with instances of various classes. The command interpreter provides functionality for creating, updating, deleting, and querying instances of different classes in the AirBnB application.

## Command Interpreter Description

The custom command interpreter, named console.py, is designed for the AirBnB project. It allows users to interact with the system through a command-line interface, executing commands to manipulate and retrieve information about instances of classes such as User, State, City, Amenity, Place, Review, and BaseModel.

## How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the following command in the terminal:

## Installation

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./console.py
```

This will launch the console, and you'll see a prompt (hbnb) indicating that you are inside the command interpreter.
